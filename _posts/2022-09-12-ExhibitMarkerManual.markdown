ExhibitMarker&trade; is an application that I was the sole developer for at Impact Trial Consulting, LLC.  It enables the user to design and apply custom headers, footers, and PDF stamps to mark documents for identification as required by courts during litigation.

Historically this was a physical operation done with self-adhesive stickers that were either handwritten or pre-printed using templates.  Recently custom PDF stamps have been implemented, but this was still a time-consuming task.  ExhibitMarker&trade; has greater customization options and streamlines the production process to reduce time and errors.
