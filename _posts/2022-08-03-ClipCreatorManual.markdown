Clip Creator is a utility specific to the litigation support industry, used in conjunction with presentation software to display evidence during trial.  The manual is written for technical litigation support personnel who are familiar with the making clips from video depositions of witnesses.

As part of this process designations are delivered in the form of page and line ranges, as each page of the transcript consists, generally, of twenty-five numbered lines.  The manual process for formatting is quite tedious and error prone.  Several years ago I wrote this applicaiton to speed up the process and help identify potential typos and other errors.

Because it uses a different template, the user manual is housed at a different location and can be reached via this link: **<a href="http://matthewpierce-itc.github.io/clipcreatordocs" target="_blank">Clip Creator 3.0</a>**
